# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

The objective of this project is to create a CNN that can categorize images of fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. This dataset includes grayscale images of clothing and accessories such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and footwear. The task is to accurately predict the correct category for each image while ensuring the model is efficient and robust.

1.Training data: 60,000 images

2.Test data: 10,000 images

3.Classes: 10 fashion categories

The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers with activation functions, followed by pooling layers, and ends with fully connected layers to output predictions for all 10 categories.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Import the necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and PyTorch.

### STEP 2:
Load and preprocess the dataset:

Resize images to a fixed size (128×128).
Normalize pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
Convert labels into numerical format if necessary.
### STEP 3:
Define the CNN Architecture, which includes:

Input Layer: Shape (8,128,128)
Convolutional Layer 1: 8 filters, kernel size (16×16), ReLU activation
Max-Pooling Layer 1: Pool size (2×2)
Convolutional Layer 2: 24 filters, kernel size (8×8), ReLU activation
Max-Pooling Layer 2: Pool size (2×2)
Fully Connected (Dense) Layer:
First Dense Layer with 256 neurons
Second Dense Layer with 128 neurons
Output Layer for classification
### STEP 4:
Define the loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss for classification) and optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD).

### STEP 5:
Train the model by passing training data through the network, calculating the loss, and updating the weights using backpropagation.

### STEP 6:
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics.

### STEP 7:
Make predictions on new images and analyze the results.
